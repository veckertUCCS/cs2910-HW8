# Opening
For this project, I followed along with MDN's tutorial for developing a To-Do application with React. What follows is a chronicle of what I enjoyed, what I found frustrating, and (hopefully) something rather entertaining.

# Likes
I really enjoyed React's implementation of the JSX syntax, which let me write code that resembled HTML alongside and within my JavaScript code. React then compiles this JSX into code that can be interpreted by the browser. This made writing code to programmatically generate HTML elements much more intuitive because it felt like I was writing standard HTML for the most part. I also found the file structure of the React project to be fairly intuitive to naviate through, with the individual sections of the app detailed in a components directory for easy reference, more high-level structural components contained in the parent src directory, and outward-facing content served to the client browser detailed in the adjacent public directory. This made it easy to navigate through the files of the project and find what I needed to review and work on. Another thing I thought was neat was how you can import CSS directly into your JavaScript code and React will handle the rendering for it.

This isn't necessarily related to React itself, but working through the tutorial for the framework taught me some more about what you can do with Javascript. I learned that you can create dictionary-esque objects with values representing functions, which can then be passed to selectively invoke methods depending on conditions, which I thought was cool!


# Dislikes
This is likely a product of my relative unfamiliarity with JavaScript, but the extensive use of functional syntax made understanding a particular block of code's purpose more challenging for me. I also had a difficult time working with effects and state in the application, the structure of React's use of the useEffect and useState functions was unintuitive to me, and I would definitely need to put in more time working with them on my own to develop a concrete understanding of them. That's really the core of my difficulties with React, I just haven't spent enough time working with it to feel condifent in my abilities, but those problems can be solved with time and effort.

# Entertainment
I spent some time pondering what one could consider entertaining in this context, and my mind's eye yielded naught but yet a different question that plagued my conscience throughout this work. I hereby present this question in the hopes that one may gaze upon it and glean something more than I...

_If the early bird catches the worm... is a bird in the hand worth two in the bush?_
